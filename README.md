# üìä VEHICLE LOAN ANALYTICS
In this project, I delved into a detailed analysis of a vehicle loan dataset for an Asset Financing Company.

I performed an extensive analysis of the dataset using `BigQuery` to run a significant number of SQL queries.
In the analysis, I explored key areas such as demographics, financial stability, employment trends, risk assessment, and profitability.
Then finally, I visualized the findings in `Looker Studio`, enabling data-driven strategic decisions for optimizing loan offerings and managing risks effectively.

# Uncovering Patterns in Vehicle Loan Data
## üßë‚Äçüíª Project Overview
I analyzed the demographics of loan applicants, including age, gender, and geographic spread, to gain insights for targeted marketing.
Then I assessed the financial well-being of the applicants by examining their credit scores, income disparities, and correlations between income and credit scores to identify high-risk profiles.

Employment trends were then explored to understand their impact on loan amounts. Then finally, I conducted a profitability analysis by comparing loan requests from existing and new customers and evaluating interest rate scenarios for potential returns.

>This project ultimately helps the Asset Financing Company better understand their customer base and optimize loan offerings for profitability while minimizing risk.

## 2. üí∏ Financial Stability
I conducted a thorough examination of the financial stability of applicants by calculating average credit scores and identifying those with low credit scores.
Additionally, I analyzed income disparities among applicants to understand their financial backgrounds better.

Furthermore, I investigated correlations between income and credit scores to identify high-risk profiles, such as applicants with low income and poor credit histories.
I also analyzed loan requests by breaking down the average loan tenure and Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly focusing on high-risk loans where the LTV exceeds 80%.

### Question 1:
**What is the average credit score of all applicants?**
```sql
SELECT AVG (`Credit Score`) AS Avg_credit_score
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`;
```

```sql
SELECT (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`)) AS Percent_high_income
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
WHERE Income > 100000;
```

## 3. üë©‚Äçüíº Employment and Occupation Trends
Using SQL queries, I explored employment and occupation-related trends to determine which employment categories and occupations request higher loan amounts.
This analysis is essential for understanding how employment types influence loan requests and associated risks.

### Question 1:
**Which employment category has the highest average income?**
```sql
SELECT `Employment Profile`, ROUND(AVG(`Income`), 2) AS Avg_income
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
GROUP BY `Employment Profile`
ORDER BY Avg_income DESC;

SELECT `Occupation`, ROUND(AVG(`Loan Amount`), 2) AS Avg_loan_amount
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
GROUP BY `Occupation`
ORDER BY Avg_loan_amount DESC;
```

## 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is another critical focus of this project.

This is where I identified applicants with multiple existing loans and high LTV ratios that may pose significant risks.
By analyzing these factors, I aimed to provide insights into which applicants may be more likely to default on their loans.

### Question 1:
**Which applicants have an LTV ratio above 80% and more than 3 existing loans?**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
WHERE `LTV Ratio` > 80 AND `Number of Existing Loans` > 3;
```

### Question 2:
**Which applicants with a credit score below 600 have more than 2 existing loans?**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
WHERE `Credit Score` < 600 AND `Number of Existing Loans` > 2;
```

### Question 3:
**What is the total outstanding loan amount for applicants with more than 5 existing loans?**
```sql
SELECT SUM(`Loan Amount`) AS Total_outstanding_loan
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
WHERE `Number of Existing Loans` > 5;
```
![total outstanding loan amount for applicants with more than 5 existing loans](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/177fd899-3c37-4385-ab3e-5c79236216b6)



### Question 4:
**What is the average loan amount requested by applicants with a credit score below 400?**
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(`Loan Amount`), 2) AS Avg_loan_amount
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
WHERE `Credit Score` < 400;
```

### Question 5:
**How many applicants have a profile score above 80 and a credit score above 700?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
WHERE `Profile Score` > 80 AND `Credit Score` > 700;
```

## 5. üìà Profitability Analysis
I examined the loan requests of existing customers versus new customers and calculated profitability scenarios based on loan amounts and interest rates.
This analysis helps understand the potential returns from different customer segments.

### Question 1:
**What is the total loan amount requested by existing customers vs. new customers?**
```sql
SELECT `Existing Customer`, SUM(`Loan Amount`) AS Total_loan_amount
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
GROUP BY `Existing Customer`;
```

### Question 2:
**If an applicant with an income of ‚Çπ50,000 requests a loan of ‚Çπ500,000, what should be their monthly EMI over a tenure of 60 months (assuming 15% interest)?**
```sql
WITH Loan_details AS
                  (SELECT 500000 AS principal, 0.15 / 12 AS monthly_rate, 60 AS tenure_months)

SELECT ROUND(principal * monthly_rate * POWER(1 + monthly_rate, tenure_months) / (POWER(1 + monthly_rate, tenure_months) - 1), 2)
      AS monthly_emi
FROM Loan_details;
```

### Question 3:
**What percentage of applicants with a loan tenure above 36 months have an LTV ratio greater than 85%?**
```sql
SELECT (COUNT(*) * 100.0 /
                         (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data` WHERE `Loan Tenure` > 36))
                                 AS percentage
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
WHERE `Loan Tenure` > 36 AND `LTV Ratio` > 85;
```

### Question 4:
**Which applicants have requested loan amounts more than 4 times their annual income?**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `Vehicle_Loan_Data.Credit Data`
WHERE `Loan Amount` > 4 * `Income`;
```


# üìä Visualizations in Looker Studio
To accompany the insights derived from the analysis, I created visualizations in Looker Studio.

![Vehicle Loan Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1108abe8-9ee2-46b2-8c34-b33790538bb0)

To view the Dashboard in Looker Studio, click [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/d8eccb89-1dc5-4f6c-a001-34c2611801ac).

These visual representations of complex data patterns illustrate customer behavior, risk profiles, and loan distributions, supporting strategic business decisions and enhancing the overall understanding of the data.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis of the vehicle loan dataset has provided invaluable insights into applicants' profiles, their financial health, and the dynamics of loan performance within the Asset Financing sector.

By leveraging key inquiry questions, I was able to explore various dimensions of the data, including demographic trends, creditworthiness, and the distribution of loan amounts.
Thus, the insights derived from this project would offer a strategic foundation for the company to refine its lending practices and risk assessment procedures, which would then empower the company to navigate the complexities of the vehicle loan market, enhance competitiveness, and foster its long-term growth.
