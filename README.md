# 📊 VEHICLE LOAN ANALYTICS
## Uncovering Patterns in Vehicle Loan Data
In this project, I delved into a detailed analysis of a vehicle loan dataset for an Asset Financing Company.

## Project Overview
1. **Demographics Analysis**:
In this section, I calculated the average age of loan applicants, analyzed gender distributions, and explored the geographic spread of applicants across states and cities. This analysis helps in understanding the demographics of the applicant pool, which is crucial for targeted marketing and risk assessment.

2. **Financial Health**:
I conducted a thorough examination of the financial health of applicants by calculating average credit scores and identifying those with low credit scores. Additionally, I analyzed income disparities among applicants to better understand their financial backgrounds. Furthermore, I investigated correlations between income and credit scores to identify high-risk profiles, such as applicants with low income and poor credit histories. I also analyzed loan requests by breaking down the average loan tenure and Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly focusing on high-risk loans where the LTV exceeds 80%.

3. **Employment and Occupation Trends**:
Using SQL queries, I explored employment and occupation-related trends to determine which employment categories and occupations request higher loan amounts. This analysis is essential for understanding how employment types influence loan requests and associated risks.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
Risk assessment is another critical focus of this project. I identified applicants with multiple existing loans and high LTV ratios that may pose significant risks. By analyzing these factors, I aimed to provide insights into which applicants may be more likely to default on their loans.

5. **Profitability Analysis**:
In this section, I examined the loan requests of existing customers versus new customers and calculated profitability scenarios based on loan amounts and interest rates. This analysis helps in understanding the potential returns from different customer segments.

6. **Visualizations in Looker Studio**:
To accompany the insights derived from the analysis, I created visualizations in Looker Studio. These visual representations of complex data patterns illustrate customer behavior, risk profiles, and loan distributions, supporting strategic business decisions and enhancing the overall understanding of the data.

>This project ultimately helps the Asset Financing Company better understand their customer base and optimize loan offerings for profitability while minimizing risk.
