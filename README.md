## Uncovering Patterns in Vehicle Loan Data
In this project, I delved into a detailed analysis of a vehicle loan dataset for an Asset Financing Company primarily focused on vehicles.

The project is split into various analytical categories, beginning with Demographics Analysis, where I calculated the average age of loan applicants, analyzes gender distributions, and explored the geographic spread of applicants across states and cities.
Financial health is thoroughly examined by calculating average credit scores, identifying applicants with low credit scores, and analyzing income disparities.
I also investigated correlations between income and credit scores to identify high-risk profiles, such as applicants with low income and poor credit histories.
Furthermore, I analyzed loan requests by breaking down the average loan tenure and Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly focusing on high-risk loans where the LTV exceeds 80%.

I also used `SQL queries` to explore employment and occupation-related trends, determining which employment categories and occupations request higher loan amounts.
Risk assessment is another critical focus, identifying applicants with multiple existing loans and high LTV ratios that may pose significant risks.
Through Profitability Analysis, I examined the loan requests of existing vs. new customers and calculates profitability scenarios based on loan amounts and interest rates.

Visualizations in Looker Studio accompany the insights, offering a visual representation of complex data patterns, such as customer behavior, risk profiles, and loan distributions, to support strategic business decisions.

*This project ultimately helps the Asset Financing Company better understand their customer base and optimize loan offerings for profitability while minimizing risk.*
